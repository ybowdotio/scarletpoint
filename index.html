      <p class="text-gray-300">Scarlet Point is a research and storytelling initiative revealing the ontological unity between the broken body of Christ and broken symmetry in the Standard Model of physics. It weaves theology, cosmology, and narrative into a single unveiling.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">A radical theological hypothesis: that the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world is not metaphor but mechanism. That Christ's broken body is the structure of spacetime itself. Read excerpts, explore the implications, or download the thesis.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-300 mb-4">The Jailbreaking Christ Thesis</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        The central claim of the Jailbreaking Christ thesis is that the universe itself is the broken body of the Son — not allegorically or symbolically, but ontologically and structurally. This breaks the illusion that science and theology operate in separate domains. The same broken symmetry that gives rise to mass, force, and field in physics is the very act of sacrifice spoken of in Scripture.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Christ is not merely a historical figure who suffered at the hands of men, but a cosmic Lamb who was broken "from the foundation of the world" — not in time, but as time. The crucifixion is the unveiling of a truth that already upholds all reality.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Jailbreaking Christ is not about undermining the faith, but freeing it from centuries of theological enclosure. It is an invitation to behold the Lamb in the language of physics, and to see creation as altar.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-300 mb-4">Jailbreaking Christ – Core Insights</h2>

        <details class="bg-gray-800 rounded p-4">
          <summary class="cursor-pointer text-red-400 font-semibold">1. The Trinity Re-examined</summary>
          <p class=\"mt-2 text-gray-300\">Scarlet Point challenges the Nicene formula by asserting that the Father-Son relationship is not metaphorical or symbolic, but ontologically real. This begetting is the actual origin point of creation itself, not an abstraction. The Nicene emphasis on co-equality obscures the Father's generative role and the Son's obedience through suffering.<br><blockquote class='border-l-4 border-red-600 pl-4 mt-2 italic text-sm text-red-200'>““This concept of the Trinity as it emerged from the battle of the three-month-long Nicean conference—I suggest—became the quintessential contraceptive that denies both God’s genuine fatherhood and Christ’s true sonship.””</blockquote>

          <summary class="cursor-pointer text-red-400 font-semibold">2. The Cosmos as the Body of Christ</summary>
          <p class=\"mt-2 text-gray-300\">Scarlet Point presents the universe as the literal, broken body of Christ — not symbol, but structure. What physicists describe as broken symmetry is the very substance of the Son slain before time began. Creation is cruciform at its core.<br><span class='italic text-sm text-red-200'>“A reality (Son) born in an instant from some birthing reality (Father), immediately broken, and through its broken body granting not only life to every particle in the Cosmos…”</span>

        <details class="bg-gray-800 rounded p-4">
          <summary class="cursor-pointer text-red-400 font-semibold">3. Sacrifice as Physical Law</summary>
          <p class=\"mt-2 text-gray-300\">Scarlet Point teaches that the fundamental interactions of matter, mass, and force are not accidental — they are the physics of divine love. The crucifixion is not merely an historical moment; it is a phase transition that defines being itself.<br><span class='italic text-sm text-red-200'>“Every instant of space-time, matter, and energy exists moment by moment because some transcendent body was broken, and from that broken body emanates the structure and flow of all life.”</span>
        </details>
        <details class="bg-gray-800 rounded p-4">
          <summary class="cursor-pointer text-red-400 font-semibold">4. Theology and Physics as One Revelation</summary>
          <p class=\"mt-2 text-gray-300\">Scarlet Point proposes a jailbreak from the false dichotomy between faith and science. Scripture and quantum field theory are not opposites — they are differently angled reflections of the same ontological rupture and redemption.<br><span class='italic text-sm text-red-200'>“The Universe is the broken body of Christ, and the orthodoxies of biblicism and scientism have jailed this reality.”</span>

        <details class="bg-gray-800 rounded p-4">
          <summary class="cursor-pointer text-red-400 font-semibold">5. A Call to Rebuild the Frame</summary>
          <p class=\"mt-2 text-gray-300\">Scarlet Point invites theologians and physicists alike to step outside inherited models and embrace the crucified Christ as the fabric, not just the savior, of reality. It is both a theological reckoning and a scientific reformation.<br><span class='italic text-sm text-red-200'>“That very instance when Jesus uttered the words ‘This is my body which is broken for you’ were true in the most profound sense imaginable... that bread he held... was, in the deepest sense possible, actually his broken body.”</span>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-red-600 pl-4 italic">
      “Absolutely love this book!”
      <span class="block text-sm text-red-200 mt-1">— Christine Wise (April 7, 2025)</span>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-red-600 pl-4 italic">
      “The book is a little ahead of its time for many circles but the framework through which it is written is the antidote to the pathologies of the modern western culture.
      The framework is grounded in the reality that existed before the Bible was ever written and the reality that will exist long after theologians have thoroughly confused themselves with 'the right interpretation of scripture.'”
      <span class="block text-sm text-red-200 mt-1">— Jeremy Horning (February 2, 2025)</span>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-red-600 pl-4 italic">
      “It’s not every day you come across a book that bridges the gap between the gospel and science and actually shows how they support each other. Most people pick one side or the other. Eugene doesn’t. He brings both together with clarity and conviction. This book is incredible, and I’m genuinely grateful he took the time to write it. It’s one of those reads that sticks with you.”
      <span class="block text-sm text-red-200 mt-1">— Craig Hostetler (May 18, 2025)</span>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-red-600 pl-4 italic">
      “I don't know if I have words to explain the awe that built within me as I read this book... So many question marks in my framework of reality were replaced by exciting possibilities. Things of God and spiritual reality that I encountered during the darkest time of my life were affirmed. I love how Eugene wrestled with and proposed answers to so many profound questions without being dogmatic or coming across as having arrived. Rather sparking the desire to continue this deep dive into the endless mystery of Christ. Get it and read it. You won't be able to put it down!”

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-red-600 pl-4 italic">
      “Eugene L. Ulrich's 'Jailbreaking Christ' challenges conventional interpretations, offering a refreshing take on Christ beyond the confines of traditional chapter and verse. The cover is what drew me in, what a cool design! As for the words under the cover, they had scholarly rigor, profound insights, and a liberated perspective of Christ. This book is a thought-provoking journey that encourages a deeper understanding of the spiritual essence, transcending the limitations of scriptural confinement. A must-read for those seeking a transformative and expansive view of Christ's teachings.”
